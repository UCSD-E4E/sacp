Files and explanations in UCSD-E4E/sacp/panorama:

Makefile: Linux/Unix compatible makefile (assumes you have make utility and gcc
          as a compiler)
  
  -Targets: gigapan - gigapan coordinate generator, executable named "gigapan".
            clean   - removes all object files (.o) and "gigapan"
            re      - make clean && make (gigapan)

gigapan.h: this has auxiliary functions which are useful for various panorama 
           needs

gigapan.c: gigapan coordinate generator. 
  
  -Compilation: try the given make file. "make" or "make gigapan" should do it.
  
  -Usage: Run the executable once, and it will give you an interactive dialog
          walkthrough, with command line argument syntax at the end.

pdf/tex: includes mathematical background/derivations for everything in 
         gigapan.c (TODO). The comments in gigapan* should be fairly 
         comprehensive.

testparams.txt: Text file with sample parameters for conveniently testing the 
                gigapan program. Suggested use - ./gigapan < test > /dev/null
