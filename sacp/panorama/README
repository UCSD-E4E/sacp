Files and explanations in UCSD-E4E/sacp/panorama:

Makefile: Linux/Unix compatible makefile (assumes you have make 
          utility and gcc as a compiler)
  
  -Targets: gigapan - gigapan coordinate generator, executable named 
                      "gigapan".
            clean - removes all object files (.o) and "gigapan"


gigapan.h: this has auxiliary functions which are useful for any panorama needs


gigapan.c: gigapan coordinate generator. 
  
  -Compilation: try the given make file. "make" or "make gigapan" should do it.
  
  -Usage: should be self explanatory; if using first time, try simply running the 
          executable. It has an interactive dialog listing all expectations and 
          requirements.


pdf: includes mathematical background/derivations for everything in gigapan.c
